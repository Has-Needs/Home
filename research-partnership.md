# Has-Needs Research Partnership Opportunities

*The perfect participatory research platform, built on architectural sovereignty.*

## For Researchers

Has-Needs provides unprecedented research capabilities that existing platforms cannot match:

**Cryptographic Consent Contracts:**
One-to-one agreements between researchers and sovereign participants. No extraction, no intermediary control.

**Voluntary Data Sharing:**
Participants choose what to share, with whom, and when. Granular control at the individual data point level.

**Longitudinal Access:**
Same sovereign participants across multiple deployments and contexts.

**Architectural Ethics:**
Vastly superior to "buying survey responses for $1 each." Participants are partners, not data sources.

**Real-World Context:**
Research during actual disaster coordination, refugee migration, indigenous knowledge sharing, community mutual aid.

## Current Research Opportunities

**First Deployment:** County-level disaster coordination
- Document whether sovereign coordination outperforms command-and-control
- Measure realized cost savings (5% economic model)
- Track prosocial behavior emergence
- Assess participatory research quality vs traditional methods

**Research Questions:**
- Does architectural sovereignty perform as theory predicts?
- Can post-capitalist economics sustain public infrastructure?
- How does elimination of extraction affect participant engagement?
- What emerges from truly bottom-up ontology building?

## Partnership Model

**You provide:** Research design, documentation, analysis, publication
**We provide:** Deployment, real-time voluntary data access, participant consent management
**Outcome:** Co-authored publications documenting unprecedented research
